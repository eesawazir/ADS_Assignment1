Implemented a counting and radix sort to solve a problem.

The problem was:

You are given a list of strings. When a string is rotated by p palces to the left, that is called a p-rotation. 
The task was to execute p-rotations on each string in the list and find out if the rotated string is present in the input list.

This task was supposed to be done in O(NM) where N is the number of strings in the input list and M is the maximum number of letters in a word, among all words in the input list.
